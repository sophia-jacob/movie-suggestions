What my project is:
My project is called Movie Suggestions and it is a website that provides movie recommendations in different sorts of ways. It starts with providing a basic list of movie recommendations. After that, there is a feature where you can choose the genre and it will give you a suggestion based on that. Then, you can click on a link which takes you to more recommendations and if you hover over the cards, it tells you the genre.

Why I made it:
I made this project because I love movies and I wanted to create a platform where people can easily find movie recommendations based on their interests. I noticed that many people often ask for movie suggestions, and I thought it would be helpful to have a website that not only lists movies but also allows users to explore different genres and discover new films they might enjoy.

How I made the project:
I used HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website. The HTML structure includes a header, a movie grid with cards for each movie, and an interactive section where users can select a genre to get a random movie suggestion. The CSS was used to style the layout and appearance of the website and create interactive features like hovering, while JavaScript handles the functionality of picking a random movie based on the selected genre.

What I struggled with/learned: 
It was initially hard to make the feature where if you choose a genre, it will pick out a movie. I learned how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create interactive elements. I also learned how to style the website effectively using CSS to make it visually appealing in a way I am typically not used to.
